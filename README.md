# GitHub Visitor Counter

![Visitor Count](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=blue&label=Visitors&query=visitors&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub-profile-views.onrender.com%2Fcount)

A simple Node.js and Express.js project that counts the number of visitors to your GitHub profile or repository. The count updates every time someone visits the deployed link.

## 🚀 Features
- Tracks and displays visitor count
- Simple API to retrieve the count in JSON format
- Easy to deploy on platforms like Render or Replit

## 📌 How It Works
1. A Node.js server keeps track of visitors in a text file.
2. Every time someone accesses the `/` endpoint, the count increases.
3. The `/count` endpoint returns the current visitor count in JSON format.
4. A badge in your `README.md` dynamically updates with the visitor count.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-visitor-counter.git
cd github-visitor-counter
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run Locally
```sh
node index.js
```
- Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see the visitor count.
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/count` to get the count in JSON format.

## 🚀 Deployment
### **Option 1: Deploy on Render**
1. Go to [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Create a **New Web Service** and link this repository.
3. Set **Build Command** to:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Set **Start Command** to:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
5. Deploy and note your **public URL**.

### **Option 2: Deploy on Replit**
1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/).
2. Create a **New Repl** and select **Node.js**.
3. Paste the `index.js` code and click **Run**.
4. Copy the **Replit URL**.

## 📌 Add to GitHub README
Once deployed, add this to your `README.md`:
```markdown
![Visitor Count](https://your-deployed-url.com/count)
```
This will dynamically update the visitor count every time someone views your profile!
